{lib, ...}:
# This module contains workarounds for PipeWire/WirePlumber issues specifically
# related to Intel Sound Open Firmware (SOF) devices, often found on newer Dell XPS
# and other laptops (e.g., sof-soundwire).
# These issues typically manifest as "Broken pipe" errors, "resync" messages in logs,
# audio stuttering, choppiness, or complete audio failure, especially under load
# (e.g., video calls).
# Troubleshooting:
# If audio problems persist with this configuration:
# 1. Monitor user journal logs: journalctl --user -f | grep 'pipewire\|wireplumber\|alsa'
# 2. Look for "Broken pipe" or "resync" errors related to "hw:sofsoundwire".
# 3. Try adjusting the 'api.alsa.headroom' value below. Increase it further (e.g., 32768)
#    if errors persist, or decrease it (e.g., 8192, 4096) if latency becomes noticeable.
# 4. Less likely, but 'api.alsa.period-size' could also be adjusted (powers of 2).
# 5. Check PipeWire/WirePlumber/SOF bug trackers for hardware-specific issues.
